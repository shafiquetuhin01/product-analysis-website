              The MacBook Air, powered by Appleâ€™s M1 processor, is the best
              laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and
              256 GB of storage, starts at $999.

              Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the
              Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year,
              including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam,
              fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard.
